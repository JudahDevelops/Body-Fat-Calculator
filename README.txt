##Body Fat Calculator 
I am on a bit of a holiday so I cannot code as much as I would like so this project was basically to still keep in touch with my  skills whilst improbing my jsc skills so basically in this one I only used the codeium chat and ignored the autocomplete because in the last challenge the autocomplete basically did all the work form me and I actully didn't benefit much from that project so for the rest of the projects I will be doing it will only be with the chat y'know just in case I get stuck.

I greatly improved my js from this project although not very pro looking, and I explored other styling options which came out beautifully at the end, the best UI I have come  up with so far.
